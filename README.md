Supplementary material for the article ["Foundations of Prescriptive Process Monitoring"] by Irene Teinemaa, Niek Tax, [Massimiliano de Leoni](http://www.win.tue.nl/~mdeleoni/), [Marlon Dumas](http://kodu.ut.ee/~dumas/), and Fabrizio Maria Maggi.

The code provided in this repository implements the techniques for alarm-based prescriptive process monitoring.
Furthermore, the repository provides an implementation of the experimental setus and can be used to investigate:
* The effect of different cost models on the benefit of an alarm-based prescriptive process monitoring system.
* The effect of different alarming strategies on the performance of the alarm-based prescriptive process monitoring system.
* The effect of different probabilistic classification algorithms on the performance of the alarm-based prescriptive process monitoring system.
